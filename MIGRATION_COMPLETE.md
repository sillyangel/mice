## 🔄 Migration Path

1. **Backup**: Old Firebase and static data moved to `-old` directories
2. **Dependencies**: Firebase packages removed, crypto built-in used
3. **Environment**: New `.env.local` needed with Navidrome credentials
4. **Data Flow**: `Static JSON → Firebase → Navidrome API`
5. **Authentication**: `Firebase Auth → Navidrome Server Authentication`
6. **Streaming**: `Static Files → Navidrome Stream API`

## 🚦 Ready for Production

The application is now fully migrated and ready for use with any Navidrome server. All core functionality has been preserved and enhanced:

- ✅ Browse music library (albums, artists, songs)
- ✅ Audio playback with queue management  
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Playlist management
- ✅ Favorites/starring
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

**Next Steps**: Set up Navidrome server and configure connection in `.env.local`
